Final Project by Samarth Arora, Uzonna Alexander and Patrick Ene

Gameplay Loop and Controls:
-Use A and D keys for left/right movement
-Use F to fire your weapon
-Use R to switch weapons
-Use TAB to open UI menu
-Use ESC to quit
The spaceships constantly moves forward and you need to kill as many enemies and
survive as long as you can.



Game Mechanics:
Our game keeps track of score, health and time. The game speeds up, more enemies spawn and
they spawn faster as the game progresses.



Enemies: Unfinished



Collectible Items:
There are health, ammo and star pickups. 
Health grants +1 health
Ammo grants +10 minigun ammo
Star grants invincibility for 5s (timer)
These collectibles spawn randomly in random positions as the game goes on.



Movement:
Enemies spawn moving in a circle using a parametric equation
Player movement uses physics based motion
Enemies turn and move towards the player at close range



Game World:
The game world is large and uses tiling so you can't leave the play area for a long time



Particle Systems:
The spaceship uses a particle system as the engine. The first bullet type also has an attached particle effect.
Finally, when you kill a spaceship with bullets, that causes an explosion.



UI:
TAB allows the player to access the menu, which shows health remaining, time spent in game,
ammo remaining and total kills. The player's total kills and time survived is displayed on death.
UI uses the external library Dear ImGUI (https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)



Advanced Method: Unfinished



Code Readability:
There are comments throughout that explain the inner-workings of the project



Bonus: Unfinished





Developed on Windows 11.
